Nice — good choice. I’ll give you a no-fluff, end-to-end plan you can follow line-by-line: where to get data, what to build, exact steps, tools, evaluation tips, pitfalls, and a short folder + notebook template. If you want I’ll also generate starter code/notebook for one of the datasets below (say the Kaggle credit card dataset).

# Quick dataset picks (start here)

1. **Kaggle — Credit Card Fraud (creditcard.csv)** — classic, small, labeled, highly imbalanced (492 frauds / 284,807 rows). Good for prototyping and learning pipeline/metrics. ([Kaggle][1])
2. **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (Vesta / large e-commerce dataset)** — bigger, richer features, used in a major Kaggle competition (realistic, harder). Use if you want to work large/realistic. ([Kaggle][2])
3. **PaySim / synthetic mobile-money simulator datasets** — synthetic but realistic behavior for mobile payments; great for trying sequence and network features or fraud injection experiments. Available on GitHub and Kaggle. ([GitHub][3], [Kaggle][4])
4. **Other Kaggle synthetic/aggregated fraud datasets** — use these for experiments or to test methods across distributions. (Search Kaggle for “fraud detection datasets”.) ([Kaggle][5])

Start with (1) to build a working pipeline fast; move to (2) or PaySim when you want realistic scale and feature engineering work.

# Minimum viable project plan — step by step (do this in order)

## Phase 0 — environment + libs

* Tools: Python 3.9+, Jupyter / VS Code or Google Colab / Kaggle Notebooks.
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, xgboost/lightgbm/catboost, matplotlib, seaborn (for quick viz), SHAP, joblib, mlflow (optional), pyarrow (for parquet).
* Optional for big data: PySpark or Dask.

## Phase 1 — get data & baseline

1. Download dataset(s) (Kaggle: creditcard.csv). Load and run `df.head()` to understand columns. ([Kaggle][1])
2. Quick baseline model (sanity check): logistic regression using a minimal feature set + stratified train/test split. Measure baseline metrics (precision, recall, F1, PR-AUC). Don’t optimize yet.

## Phase 2 — exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* Class balance, fraud ratio, time distribution, transaction amounts distribution (log scale), missing values.
* Look for obvious leakage (target correlated with IDs, timestamps binned into fraud window).
* Plot: amount vs time for fraud vs legit, transaction frequency per user, top merchants, hour-of-day patterns.

## Phase 3 — preprocessing & feature engineering

* Basic cleaning: missing value strategy (impute, flag), datatype fixes.
* Numerical features: log transform skewed amounts, scale (StandardScaler or QuantileTransformer for tree models you can skip scaling).
* Categorical features: frequency encoding, target encoding (with proper CV to avoid leakage), one-hot for low-cardinality.
* Time features: hour/day-of-week, time since last transaction per user, rolling counts/sums (last 1h/24h/7d).
* Behavior features: avg amount per user, velocity features (#txns in last N minutes), device fingerprint features if available.
* Graph/network features: number of unique devices per card, merchant aggregation, transaction graph centrality (for advanced stage).
* Feature store note: compute time-windowed features carefully (use only past data when making labels).

## Phase 4 — handle imbalance (do not ignore)

* Methods: class weights in loss, **SMOTE/ADASYN** (for tabular, be careful with time splits), **RandomUnderSampler** to speed training, or **balanced batch sampling** for NN. Use imbalanced-learn.
* Prefer **threshold tuning + precision-recall curve** and cost-sensitive learning to random up/downsampling if you need real-world performance.

## Phase 5 — modeling progression (iterate)

1. **Simple models (baseline):** Logistic regression, Decision Tree.
2. **Strong tabular models:** Random Forest, XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost — these usually give the best bang for the buck.
3. **Advanced / experimental:**

   * Neural nets (with embedding layers for categorical features).
   * Autoencoder / isolation forest / deep SVDD for unsupervised anomaly detection (useful when labels are sparse).
   * Sequence models (RNN/Transformer) for per-user transaction sequences.
   * GNNs for transaction graphs (edges = transactions; nodes = users/cards/devices).
4. Use **calibration** (Platt/Isotonic) if probability outputs are required.

## Phase 6 — evaluation & cross-validation (do it right)

* Use **Precision @ k**, **Recall**, **F1**, **PR-AUC** (preferred over ROC-AUC for imbalanced). Track **false positive rate** and expected operational load.
* **Time-aware validation**: use time splits (train on past, validate on later time) — never randomly shuffle across time if time drift exists.
* **Stratified K-fold** (or stratified group K-fold by user id) when time not relevant.
* Evaluate model impact in terms of **alerts/day** (convert probability threshold to expected alerts).

## Phase 7 — explainability & rules

* Use SHAP/Tree SHAP for feature importance and to debug.
* Convert high-precision model outputs into **business rules** (e.g., block if prob > 0.9 and amount > X) to reduce human workload.
* Keep a small rule set for high-confidence automated actions and a separate queue for human review.

## Phase 8 — deployment & monitoring

* Deployment options: REST API (Flask/FastAPI), batch scoring (Airflow), streaming (Kafka + Flink), or serverless (Cloud Functions).
* Monitor: data drift, model performance (precision/recall), latency, feature distributions, and volume of alerts.
* Retraining policy: scheduled retrain + triggered retrain on drift. Keep a simple retrain pipeline first.

## Phase 9 — production concerns & ethics

* Privacy: anonymize PII, follow GDPR or local regs.
* Label quality: labels are noisy — track label provenance.
* Cost tradeoffs: false positives cost customer friction; false negatives cost direct money. Set thresholds with business owners.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support, average_precision_score

df = pd.read_csv("data/creditcard.csv")
X = df.drop("Class", axis=1)
y = df["Class"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

clf = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced', max_iter=1000)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
probs = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
print("PR-AUC:", average_precision_score(y_test, probs))
```

# Practical tips / gotchas (from experience)

* **Do not** trust ROC-AUC alone on imbalanced fraud tasks — use PR-AUC and per-threshold precision/recall.
* Beware of **label leakage**. If a feature is derived after human review, it’ll leak the label.
* When using SMOTE / synthetic oversampling, apply it **inside CV folds** not before splitting.
* Always simulate the operational alert load: how many alerts/day at your chosen threshold?

# Where to read / references (quick)

* Kaggle credit card dataset (creditcard.csv) — good starter. ([Kaggle][1])
* IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition (Vesta dataset) — large, realistic. ([Kaggle][2])
* PaySim mobile money simulator (GitHub + Kaggle) — synthetic generator for mobile transactions. ([GitHub][3], [Kaggle][4])
* NeurIPS / academic work on synthetic financial datasets (for AML experiments). ([neurips.cc][6])

# Next concrete options (pick one)

1. I generate a **runnable Jupyter notebook** that downloads the Kaggle credit card dataset, does EDA, builds baseline models, and saves results.
2. I produce a **detailed feature engineering + model pipeline script** (train.py / features.py) for the IEEE-CIS dataset (bigger work).
3. I make a **mini end-to-end demo** using PaySim with anomaly detection (autoencoder) and evaluation.

Tell me which of the three you want and I’ll produce the code/notebook now. No fluff, full runnable code and comments.
