# Data Science Project Repository

This repository, **`data_science_project`**, is a collection of end-to-end data science and machine learning projects.  
Each project is organized into its own folder with dedicated notebooks, datasets (or links to sources), preprocessing steps, models, and evaluation results.  

The goal of this repo is to showcase practical applications of data science across different domains: fraud detection, customer analytics, healthcare, and computer vision.

Each project folder has:
- **`notebooks/`** → Jupyter notebooks with analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.  
- **`data/`** → Local dataset (if small) or links to Kaggle / open datasets.  
- **`models/`** → Trained models or checkpoints.  
- **`README.md`** → Project-specific documentation.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Objective:** Detect fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.  
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, resampling (SMOTE), classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC).  
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  

---

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction (Telco IBM Dataset)
- **Objective:** Predict customer churn to help telecom companies reduce attrition.  
- **Techniques:** Feature engineering, class balancing, machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle – IBM Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  

---

### 3. Disease Prediction from Lab Test Results
- **Objective:** Build predictive models to identify disease risks based on medical lab test results.  
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, handling missing values, supervised classification, evaluation metrics.  
- **Dataset:** Source depends on availability (to be updated).  

---

### 4. Land Cover Segmentation
- **Objective:** Perform semantic segmentation on satellite imagery to classify different land cover types.  
- **Techniques:** Deep learning (CNNs, U-Net), image preprocessing, semantic segmentation metrics (IoU, Dice coefficient).  
- **Dataset:** Example – [Kaggle Land Cover Segmentation Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/landcover).  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (for segmentation tasks)  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Kaggle
